        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p class="text3">So when my mom was pregnant, she was in the UAE, Years later, she decides to go home to the
            Philippines. I was born in LMC. Going back, we lived in alaminos for 4 Years. My mom worked in smart with the
            role of being a Manager. She invites me to her office sometimes. My dad, On the other hand, was in a band and
            played instruments too. After the 4 years in Alaminos, We went to Mangaldan. I personally grewm up in Mangaldan
            but I do miss Alaminos. In 2013, My little brother was born. He's very annoying but i dont care, he's my brother
            after all. My brother goes to CMS too, His name is Marius Kian Roces Idia. Also in 2013, My Grandma died ( The
            wife of Lolo Cesar Idia), I didnt know what was happening because I was so little back then. I was a Honor
            student back then, but it all stopped when i was grade 4. I lost motivation to study, Or were the subjects just
            too hard? either way, im not an honor student anymore. Now, Grade 7. Im doing my Best to get back in the honor
            roll, or to be a silver awardee. </p>
