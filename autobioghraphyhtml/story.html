    <h1 class="text3">So when my mom was pregnant, she was in the UAE, Years later, she decides to go home to the Philippines. I was born in
    LMC. Going back, we lived in alaminos for 4 Years. My mom worked in smart with the role of being a Manager. She invites
    me to her office sometimes. My dad, On the other hand, was in a band and played instruments too. After the 4 years in
    Alaminos, We went to Mangaldan. I personally grewm up in Mangaldan but I do miss Alaminos. In 2013, My little brother
    was born. He's very annoying but i dont care, he's my brother after all. My brother goes to CMS too, His name is Marius
    Kian Roces Idia. Also in 2013, My Grandma died ( The wife of Lolo Cesar Idia), I didnt know what was happening because I
    was so little back then. I was a Honor student back then, but it all stopped when i was grade 4. I lost motivation to
    study, Or were the subjects just too hard? either way, im not an honor student anymore. Now, Grade 7. Im doing my Best
    to get back in the honor roll, or to be a silver awardee. My parents have a bussiness called yummy tokyo, we sell ramen kits or ramen. We would deliver these to people just like food panda.</h1>
